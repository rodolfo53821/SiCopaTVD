This is a software for viewing MHP Xlets on a PC. It is NOT a complete MHP implementation and shall not be treated as such.


XleTView uses the following software:
NanoXML parser (Marc De Scheemaecker, http://nanoxml.n3.net)
Javassist (Shigeru Chiba, http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/)
Metouia look & feel(Taoufik Romdhane, (http://mlf.sourceforge.net/)

When XleTView loads your Xlet it modifies the Xlet's bytecode. 
These modifications happens only in the memory of the Virtual Machine, but you should be aware of it.


some of the changes in 0.3.6

- implementations of HText, HIcon, HAnimation, HStaticAnimation, HAnimateLook, HGraphicButton, HTextButton
  HSinglelineEntryLook, HSinglelineEntry + more...
- New customizable remote control
- fixed bugs in org.dvb.net.rc.ConnectionRCInterface, HStaticText, HStaticIcon + more



Requirements:
- Sun's sdk 1.4

Install:

- Put the files where you want them.
- Double click on xletview.jar (Windows) or run from console
  If you do the double clicking you will not get debug output. So if you want to see
  your "sysouts" you have to run from console
(If you have Sun's sdk 1.4 but not as the default runtime you need to start from console)
- Some settings can be changed in config/settings.txt
