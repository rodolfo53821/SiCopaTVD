<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Java's security model addresses permitting or denying access to
resoruces, based on the source of the code requesting access.  It
is a tried and proven architecture that has benefited from years
of experience.  In computer workstations and personal computers,
the &quot;source&quot; from which code comes is, generally speaking, determined
by the site from which the code is downloaded (often a URL), or by
a trusted signer who has signed the code.
</p><p>
The Java security model is readily applicable to interactive television,
and provides clear benefits.  It allows a responsible party to reliably
prevent classes of code from accessing resources that the code shouldn't
need access to.  For example, an advertising application can be pervented
from changing the channel to a network owned by the advertiser, an
application can be granted access to select only certain services (such
as those within a bouquet), an
application can be prevented from accessing the return channel, or
it can be denied access to a users' in-home network.  Providing a simple,
reliable mechanism to deny such access provides important benefits,
including cost reductions, particularly in a horizontal market.
</p><p>
It can be argued that applications could be exhaustively tested to ensure
that they don't misbehave.  We believe that such testing is expensive
and difficult.  The Java security model frees the broadcaster from 
some of this kind of testing, by allowing it to establish 
a &quot;sandbox&quot; that constrains
the actions of applications; the Java 2 security model allows that sandbox
to be easily configurable, so that it can be expanded to fit the needs
of a given application.
</p><p>
In the Java 2 security model, permissions are expressed as subclasses
of java.security.Permission.  A method that detects the violation of
a security constraint does so by throwing a java.lang.SecurityException.
This is a subclass of java.lang.RuntimeException, but despite this,
it is required that any method of the Java TV
extension that can exit due to a SecurityException document this fact by:

       all methods that are not declared as throwing SecurityException.
       A given platform may guarantee
       that a security exception is <strong>not</strong> thrown under
       certain circumstances, thereby enlarging the minimum sandbox, but
       it may not allow a security exception to be thrown where one is not
       declared.
       <p>
    
  <li> In a horizontal market, it is very useful if the broadcaster can
       signal the set of permissions that they would like a given
       application to have.  In no case should the box give an application
       permissions that the broadcaster didn't ask for.  This relieves the
       broadcaster from the responsibility of testing for access to
       these resources.

<h3>Java TV Permissions Architecture</h3>

<p>
In this section, we discuss the permissions that exist for the
Java TV vertical extension APIs.  In addition to these permissions, 
there are the permissions that exist in the underlying Java 
platform, and permissions for any other APIs that are defined as 
part of a complete platform.

In Java TV, many resources are accessed with a Locator.  Locators are used

In many ways, a Locator is analagous to a filename in a computer 
filesystem.  In computers, a filename is often associated with a hardware
device, such as a printer and the screen (&quot;prn:&quot; 
and &quot;con:&quot; in DOS-based 
systems, and /dev/lp* and /dev/tty in Unix systems).  Associating 
permissions with files is a well-established mechanism for restricting

<font color="#000000">In many ways, a Locator is analogous to a file name
in a computer file system. In computers, a file name is often associated
with a hardware device, such as a printer and the screen ("prn:" and "con:"
in DOS-based systems, and /dev/lp* and /dev/tty in UNIX systems). Associating
permissions with files is a well established mechanism for restricting
E 3
access to data files, hardware devices, and other resources in computer
D 3
systems.
</p><p>
The Java model for access to a filesystem is twofold:  There is a
file object (java.io.File), which represents the path to an object
in the filesystem, and there is a security check based on that name.
In the Java 2 security model, that security check is reified in the
class java.io.FilePermission.  A FilePermission contans a path (or
a regular expression denoting a set of paths), and an <i>action string</i>.
The action string can be <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>, <i>execute</i>
or <i>delete</i>.  In the 1.1 security model, the same
facility is exposed through a small number of check methods on
java.lang.SecrityManager (checkRead(String), etc.).
</p><p>
The FilePermission object allows access to a set of files based on a
wildcarding mechanism.  A set of FilePermission objects may be
combined to give any desired degree of access.  For example, it is
straightforward to construct a set of two permissions that gives
code read-write access to one directory, and read-only access to
a different directory.  FilePermission is described in detail in
&quot;Inside Java 2 Platoform Security&quot; section 3.6.4.
</p><p>
A mechanism similar to FilePermission is ideally suited to the needs of 
recources that are accessed via locators.  For
example, consider the following set of permissions for an application:

<p>
This is analagous to the kinds of access that FilePermission grants.
For this reason, important permissions in the Java TV extension have
a Locator in their constructor.  Using a Locator in this way does not
place any requirements on the internal representation an implementation
maintains for a locator.  It does, however, imply a requirement on the
<i>signalling</i> of permissions.  Namely, a permission that relates to
a given locator needs to be signalled in such a way that the permission
object can determine if it grants access for a given locator.  A signalling
specification would probably define some kind of wildcarding scheme
based on paths for locators, to facilitate the natural expression of a set
of permissions.  For example, the locator for a service might have
a representation equivalent to &quot;/service/physical/channel007&quot;
or &quot;/service/logical/ESPN/TheDeuce&quot;.  Doing so would allow
logical wildcarding in the signalling of permissions.
</p><p>
The JavaTV API does not mandate any particular format for 
locators.  This is something that must be specified as part of a
complete platform.  Despite this, an application running on a platform
that implements the Java 2 security model can test whether or 
not it has access to the resource
corresponding to a given locator, with code like the following:
